# Interpreter
basic interpreter

To compile and execute run this command: g++ test.cpp -pedantic -Wall -Werror && ./a.out

This is a basic interpreter that executes basic command in a shell like enviorment and can execute instructions passed in through files and also contains error handling; you could think of it as an extremely miniature language with almost no features apart from printing, storage, and basic arithmetic operations
